        <h1>about me</h1>
        <p>I was born in Laos, and came to the U.S. as a toddler after the Vietnam War.  
            Myfamily settled in La Cross, WI because it was where we had family, 
            and I've called Wisconsin home ever since.</p>
        <p>My hobbies include reading, traveling, cooking, eating, hiking, camping, and painting.

        <h1>My Ultimate Goal</h1>
        <p>My ultimate goal in life is not to get married, have kids, or have a beautiful house even.  
            It's to travel the world! I love seeing new places and experiencing different cultures.  
            Maybe it's just me, but that feeling of being someplace different feels wonderful!  
            Especially waking up and having coffee with some pastries, staring off into some unknown beautiful landscape.
            I'd gladly live in a small apartment and spend most of my finances on crossing off my travel bucket list.
            </p>
            <p>I've been fortunate enough to have already visited a few places and even lived at a few of them for a period of time.  
                In 2011, a month after the huge tsunami that rocked Japan, I flew out to Osaka to start my study abroad at 
                Kwansei Gakuin University.  I was there for a semester and was able to live like a local, and make friends with students from around the world.  
                It was such an amazing and unforgettable experience.  The people there are so nice and helpful, and the culture is just so different and 
                interesting.  They also really like Americans for some reason.  I'd recommend Japan to anyone.  After the semester was over, I was also able to travel
                around a little to visit Tokyo, and also took a ferry over to South Korea before I came back home.
            </p>
            <p>In 2014, I went to Cape Town, South Africa for a two-month unpaid internship.  Cape Town was definitely on my bucket list, and I was 
                really glad for the opportunity to not only visit, but to be able to live there for a short time.  It is a beautiful place; there are so many 
                romantic spots!  One of the most memorable things I did there was hiking up Table Mountain, one of the seven wonders of the world.  
                I was very out of shape and the two hour hike was a killer, but once we got to the top, it was breathtaking and definitely worth.  I'm just 
                glad we took the cable car down though.  Another memorable event was taking a day trip out to Nelson Mandela's prison island; I learn so much about him and his legacy!
                The beaches were also gorgeous and the food markets were very festive with a ton of variety of food.  It was overall a pretty great experience, 
                but I think I'll categorize South Africa as a one-time-only travel destination.
            </p>
            <p>My most recent trip was in 2018; it was a solo vacation I decided to take by myself to Thailand.  I've traveled to Japan and South Africa alone, but 
                it was different because I had people waiting for me at those places.  Of course a lot of my family and friends were afraid for my safety, 
                because I'm a woman **insert eye-roll**, so much so that it got a bit... weird?  I won't give the specifics, and I really did understand their concerns 
                but their stories of solo-woman-traveling-ends-in-tragedy didn't faze me.  I hadn't planned on going alone in the beginning but I wasn't going to wait around 
                until people made time.  I gave everyone a year noticed for the trip, and there five other people who said they'd go.  But of course, as the year flew by 
                the amount of travel buddies dwindled down to zero. I wasn't mad though - people have their own lives to take care of and I wouldn't want anyone to put their 
                plans on hold because of me.  So I continued planning and took the trip myself, which turned out to be a pretty interesting experience.  The only con to 
                solo travel as that I didn't get to eat as much as I wanted to... not enough mouths to buy 10 dishes to try so I had to stick to two dishes, four max per meal.  
                I could've just bought them anyway but I hate wasting food.  Another downside was that I didn't make any friends because I was cautious of telling strangers 
                that I was traveling alone.  Those things didn't really bother me, because I still had a great time and would travel solo again.

        <h1>About the Hmongs</h1>
        <p>I always like to give a little history about the Hmong people, because I am Hmong and our history and legacy are still unknown to a lot of Americans.
            Sadly the Hmong people don't have a country to call home.  As many of the elders remember it, Hmong people originated from northern China, 
            which makes a lot people think we're Mongolians, which we are not, and nor are we Chinese or claim to be Chinese.  
            Hmong people have always been considered hilltribes or indegenous because they're mostly simple farmers who live in the hills.  The Chinese labeled them as the Miao, but the Hmongs 
            consider it as a deragortory term.  The story was, the Chinese King had a disagreement with the leader of the Hmong people, 
            therefore he kicked out all the Hmongs otherwise they would be prosecuted.  Most of the hmongs migrated down towards 
            the Southeast countries like Laos and Thailand.  The ones who chose to stay in China hid their identity and changed their language so they could blend in with the Chinese.
            I've heard that in the last 10 years, the Hmong-Chinese have finally started to feel safe enough to re-establish their Hmong identities in China again.
            <h3>So how did we come to the U.S?</h3>
             <p>Unbeknowest to a lot of Americans still, it was due to a stint the CIA conducted in the 1960s.
            The CIA dubbed it the Secret War; it was so secret that it was hidden from the American people and although the Secreat War was revealed to the public in the 70s, 
            they still left out how the Hmong people were detrimental to their "secret mission" in Laos.  The Hmongs were simple hilltribe farmers were turned in guerrilas to soldiers fighting a deadly war
            they couldn't win. The Hmongs were promised sanctuary in the U.S. after the war, but as it turned out, less than 4000 were allowed sanctuary in the U.S. after the war.  They rest 
            were accepted into other countries like France, Austrailia, and the ones who didn't get rescued were left to defend for themselves or flee as refugees to 
            Thailand.  Many of the surviving soldiers and their families were labeled as rebels and killed by the communists, other soldiers ran and hid in the jungles, and some are still 
            hiding in the jungles of Laos even today. 

            In the mid-80's, my family and I were fortunate enough to escape to Thailand.  My parents can still recall those times quite clearly: dWe traveled by foot, mostly at night,  
            until we reached the Mekong River, which separated Thailand and Laos.  One would need to have enough money to bribe a Thai boat to take his family across, otherwise, those who didn't would have to swim.
            They'd also have to make sure you have enough to bribe officials on the other side if they get caught.  Anyone could be shot on the boat at any time by snipers on either side.
            
            Once in Thailand, Hmong people were put into refugee camps and were only able to be admitted into the US if they already had relatives living in the U.S. and if they received a sponsorship.
            I get so emotional when I talk about the Hmong history because it's sad and tragic, and because the U.S. government hid the details of the secret war for so long, that Hmong people still don't get the recognition 
            for their sacrifice.
