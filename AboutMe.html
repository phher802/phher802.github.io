        <h1 class="font-monts">About me</h1>
        <p>I was born in Laos, and came to the U.S. in the mid 80's.
            My family settled in La Cross, WI because it was where we had family,
            and I've called Wisconsin home ever since.</p>
        <br>
       

        <p>My hobbies include traveling, reading, cooking, eating, hiking, camping, and painting.

        <h1 class="font-monts">Why Do I Code?</h1>
        <p>
            There were times when I’d come up with great ideas for apps, but I didn’t know how to code and make them into realities.  Those were the times when I wished I knew how to code.  I’ve always been interested in coding, since I love working with Excel.  My interest in coding grew over the last five years and eventually in 2018, I started doing serious research on how to learn and possibly make it into a career.  With that in mind, I decided to self-study with web developer courses on Udemy to learn some basic coding.  After a year of self-studying 3 hours a day, I discovered that I really liked to code; I enjoyed solving problems, building things, and feeling that euphoria when things work!
In 2020, I finally made the decision to quit my job and enroll in devCodeCamp, a fulltime, full-stack engineer bootcamp based in Milwaukee, WI.  It was very tough and fast-paced, but overall, I gained a great deal: I was able to add to my list of programming skills as well as problem solving skills, gain experience collaborating with others, and develop a better understanding of coding logic.  Bootcamp was definitely the correct choice for me.  After graduating, I look forward to continue learning and improving my coding skills.

        </p>
        <h3>My Career Goals</h3>
        <p>
            My goals are to continue learning and developing my programming skills so that I can become a useful team member.  I hope to find a position in the industry to cement my career and further those goals.

        <h1 class="font-monts">My favorite hobby is traveling to other countries and exploring their culture and history.</h1>
        <p> So far I've been to Japan, South Korea, South Africa, and Thailand.  My future travel plans include Ireland, Italy, Greece, France, Singapore, Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, Iceland... the list goes on.  I feel very fortunate to have been able to live in Japan and South Africa.

            <div class="hmong-1">
                <p>
                    I’d like to share a little bit about the Hmong history, because I am Hmong, and the sacrifice we've made
                    for the U.S. is still unknown to a lot of Americans, even after almost five decades. It’s quite a
                    compelling
                    history, so if you’d like to know more, please head on over to the History page.
