        <h1 class="font-monts">About me</h1>
        <p>I was born in Laos, and came to the U.S. in the mid 80's.
            My family settled in La Cross, WI because it was where we had family,
            and I've called Wisconsin home ever since.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My hobbies include traveling, reading, cooking, eating, hiking, camping, and painting.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h1 class="font-monts">Why Do I Want To Code?</h1>
        <p>
            I started working at the age of 15, and have since worked in many different types of office settings,
            including non-profits organizations, medical offices, mortgaging, small business start-ups, management, etc.
            Because of that I was able to work with many different types of computer software, and I believe those
            experiences will be a great asset to me with user experience programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started getting interested in coding about 10 years ago, when I started working with Excel on a daily
            basis for my job at the time. I enjoyed searching for and discovering what codes Excel had that would
            simplify things for me. It was fun to discover new functions and codes, and it felt great when they made my
            projects better and cleaner. During that time, the thought of programming was lodge in the back of my mind,
            but the idea didn’t start to take on real form until 2017. I started considering programming as a career,
            but due to financial reasons, I decided to leave it on the back burner. Then in the beginning of 2018, when
            I realized I didn’t want to continue to do what I was currently doing, I decided to do a thorough research
            on computer programming. I googled how to become a programmer, did many in-person Q&A’s with family and
            friends who were established in the industry, signed up for information sessions with Universities, on
            campus and online classes alike. A family member gave me a wonderful suggestion: do your own self-studying
            first. With that in mind, I bought a course on Udemy.com, with Angela Yu called “The Complete Web
            Development Bootcamp,” and spent seven months studying on my own after work every day. It was a very well
            taught course, and Angela was a wonderful instructor. However, I felt I need more interactions with the
            instructor(s), and maybe a little bit more information about becoming a software engineer. After thinking
            about my alternatives for very long time, and almost giving up on becoming a programmer, I decided to take a
            chance and invest in myself. I signed up with devCopeCamp, a software development boot camp located in
            Milwaukee, WI. I am currently enrolled in the class right now, and it is very challenging, but I am enjoying
            it very much.

        <h1 class="font-monts">My Ultimate Goal</h1>
        <p>My ultimate goal in life is not to get married, have kids, or have a beautiful house even.
            It's to travel the world! I love seeing new places and experiencing different cultures.
            Maybe it's just me, but that feeling of being someplace different feels wonderful!
            Especially waking up and having coffee with some pastries, and staring off into some unknown beautiful
            landscape. I'd gladly live in a small apartment and spend all my finances on crossing off my travel bucket
            list.

            <img class="japan-img" src="images/me in japan.jpg" alt="travel in Japan">

            <h2>Osaka, Japan</h2>
            <p>I considered myself fortunate enough to have already visited a few places and even lived at a few of them
                for a
                period of time. In 2011, a month after the huge tsunami that rocked Japan, I flew out to Osaka to
                start my study abroad semester at Kwansei Gakuin University. I loved being able to live like a local,
                and made friends with students from around the world. It was such an amazing and unforgettable
                experience. The people there were so nice and helpful, and the culture is just so different and
                interesting. The Japanese also really like Americans, and they love to try to practice their english
                on you. I still miss their convenience stores, my favorite might be 7Eleven, and seeing vending machines
                everywhere. I think the most shocking although delightful one I came across was a beer vending machine
                way out in the mountains where people went to hike. And when I say they had vending machines for
                everything, I mean EVERYTHING. I'd recommend Japan to anyone, go there! After the semester was over,
                I did a little bit more traveling around Japan and took the ferry over to South Korea. There are still
                a few places I'd like to see in Japan that I didn't get a chance to, so I would definitely go back to
                Japan some day. I really loved it there.

            <h2>Cape Town, South Africa</h2>
            <p>In 2014, I went to Cape Town, South Africa for a two-month unpaid internship. Cape Town was definitely on
                my bucket list, and I was really glad for the opportunity to not only visit, but to be able to live
                there for a short time. It is a beautiful place, and there are so many romantic spots! One of the most
                memorable things I did there was hiking up Table Mountain, which is one of the seven wonders of the
                world.
                I was very out of shape and the two+ hour hike was a killer, but once we got to the top, it was
                breathtaking and definitely worth. I'm just glad we took the cable car down though. Another memorable
                event was taking a day trip out to Nelson Mandela's prison island; I learn so much about him and his
                legacy!
                The beaches were also gorgeous and the food markets were very festive with a ton of variety of food. It
                was overall a pretty great experience, but I think I'll categorize South Africa as a one-time-only
                travel destination.

            <h2>Thailand</h2>
            <p>My most recent trip was in 2018 was also a very new experience for me. It was my first solo vacation to
                Thailand. I've traveled to Japan and South Africa alone, but this time I had no one waiting there for
                me. A lot of my family and friends were afraid for my safety, so much so that it got a bit... weird?
                I won't give the specifics, and I understood their concerns but their stories of
                solo-woman-traveling-ends-in-tragedy didn't faze me. I hadn't initially plan to travel alone
                but I was not going to wait around until people made time. I gave five friends a whole year
                noticed for the trip, and they were very excited, but as the year when on, the amount of travel
                buddies dwindled down to zero.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I was not upset though - people have their own lives to take care of and I wouldn't want anyone to put
                their plans or emergencies on hold because of me. So I continued planning and took the trip myself,
                which turned out to be a pretty interesting experience and not at all scary.
                The only con to solo travel as that I didn't get to eat as much as I wanted to... not enough mouths to
                buy 10 dishes t0 try; I had to stick to two dishes, or four at max if I was feeling extra hungry or
                excited. I realize I could've just bought all the dishes I wanted anyway but I hate wasting food.
                Would I do it again? Sure! There's something nice about doing whatever you want on a whim.
                I would however, prefer to travel with a few friends when I can.

                I’d like to share a little bit about the Hmong history, because I am Hmong, and the sacrifice we've made
                for the U.S. is still unknown to a lot of Americans, even after almost five decades. It’s quite a
                compelling
                history, so if you’d like to know more, please head on over to the History page.
