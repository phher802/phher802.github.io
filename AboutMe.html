        <h1 class="font-monts">About me</h1>
        <p>I was born in Laos, and came to the U.S. in the mid 80's.
            My family settled in La Cross, WI because it was where we had family,
            and I've called Wisconsin home ever since.</p>
<br>
        <p>My hobbies include traveling, reading, cooking, eating, hiking, camping, and painting.

        <h1 class="font-monts">My Ultimate Goal</h1>
        <p>My ultimate goal in life is not to get married, have kids, or have a beautiful house even.
            It's to travel the world! I love seeing new places and experiencing different cultures.
            Maybe it's just me, but that feeling of being someplace different feels wonderful!
            Especially waking up and having coffee with some pastries, and staring off into some unknown beautiful
            landscape. I'd gladly live in a small apartment and spend all my finances on crossing off my travel bucket
            list.

            <h2>Osaka, Japan</h2>
            <p>I considered myself fortunate enough to have already visited a few places and even lived at a few of them
                for a
                period of time. In 2011, a month after the huge tsunami that rocked Japan, I flew out to Osaka to
                start my study abroad semester at Kwansei Gakuin University. I loved being able to live like a local,
                and made friends with students from around the world. It was such an amazing and unforgettable
                experience. The people there were so nice and helpful, and the culture is just so different and
                interesting. The Japanese also really like Americans, and they love to try to practice their english
                on you. I still miss their convenience stores, my favorite might be 7Eleven, and seeing vending machines
                everywhere. I think the most shocking although delightful one I came across was a beer vending machine
                way out in the mountains where people went to hike. And when I say they had vending machines for
                everything, I mean EVERYTHING. I'd recommend Japan to anyone, go there! After the semester was over,
                I did a little bit more traveling around Japan and took the ferry over to South Korea. There are still
                a few places I'd like to see in Japan that I didn't get a chance to, so I would definitely go back to
                Japan some day. I really loved it there.

            <h2>Cape Town, South Africa</h2>
            <p>In 2014, I went to Cape Town, South Africa for a two-month unpaid internship. Cape Town was definitely on
                my bucket list, and I was really glad for the opportunity to not only visit, but to be able to live
                there for a short time. It is a beautiful place, and there are so many romantic spots! One of the most
                memorable things I did there was hiking up Table Mountain, which is one of the seven wonders of the
                world.
                I was very out of shape and the two+ hour hike was a killer, but once we got to the top, it was
                breathtaking and definitely worth. I'm just glad we took the cable car down though. Another memorable
                event was taking a day trip out to Nelson Mandela's prison island; I learn so much about him and his
                legacy!
                The beaches were also gorgeous and the food markets were very festive with a ton of variety of food. It
                was overall a pretty great experience, but I think I'll categorize South Africa as a one-time-only
                travel destination.

            <h2>Thailand</h2>
            <p>My most recent trip was in 2018 was also a very new experience for me. It was my first solo vacation to
                Thailand. I've traveled to Japan and South Africa alone, but this time I had no one waiting there for
                me. A lot of my family and friends were afraid for my safety, so much so that it got a bit... weird?
                I won't give the specifics, and I understood their concerns but their stories of
                solo-woman-traveling-ends-in-tragedy didn't faze me. I hadn't initially plan to travel alone
                but I was not going to wait around until people made time. I gave five friends a whole year
                noticed for the trip, and they were very excited, but as the year when on, the amount of travel
                buddies dwindled down to zero.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I was not upset though - people have their own lives to take care of and I wouldn't want anyone to put
                their plans or emergencies on hold because of me. So I continued planning and took the trip myself,
                which turned out to be a pretty interesting experience and not at all scary.
                The only con to solo travel as that I didn't get to eat as much as I wanted to... not enough mouths to
                buy 10 dishes t0 try; I had to stick to two dishes, or four at max if I was feeling extra hungry or
                excited. I realize I could've just bought all the dishes I wanted anyway but I hate wasting food.
                Would I do it again? Sure! There's something nice about doing whatever you want on a whim.
                I would however, prefer to travel with a few friends when I can.

        <img class="hmong-img-1" src="images/hilltribe.jpg" alt="Hmong woman and child">
        <h1 class="font-monts">About the Hmongs</h1>
        <div class="hmong-1">
            <p>I'd like to talk a little bit about the history about the Hmong people, because I am Hmong and my people's history and
                legacy are still unknown to a lot of Americans even though we are a part of the American history.
                Sadly the Hmong people don't have a country to call home. As many of the elders remember it,
                Hmong people originated from northern China, which make a lot people think we're Mongolians,
                which we are not, and nor are we Chinese or claim to be. Hmong people have always been
                considered hilltribes or indegenous because they're mostly simple farmers who live in the hills.
                The Chinese labeled the Hmongs as the Miao, but the Hmongs consider the name a deragortory term.
                The story was, the Chinese King had a disagreement with the leader of the Hmong people,
                therefore the Hmongs were forced to leave or face prosecution. Most of the Hmongs migrated
                down towards the Southeast countries like Laos and Thailand. The ones who chose to stay in China
                hid their identities and changed their language so they could blend in with the Chinese.
                This was way before my grandparents' time, but since the Hmongs didn't have a written language
                back then, stories are passed down through the spoken language. I've heard that in the last 10 years,
                the Hmong-Chinese have finally started to feel safe enough to re-establish their Hmong identities
                in China again. The way they speak the Hmong language is very odd, it sounds almost
                Chinese.

            <h3 class="font-monts">The Hmongs and The U.S. Government</h3>
            <p>Unbeknowest to a lot of Americans still, it was due to a stint the CIA conducted in the 1960s during the
                Vietnam War. The CIA dubbed it the Secret War; it was so secret that it was hidden from the American
                people for so long that the history is still not very well known today. Although the Secreat War was
                finally revealed to the public in the 70s, they still left out how the Hmong people were detrimental
                to the "secret mission" in Laos. The Hmongs, simple hilltribe farmers, were turned in guerrilas soldiers
                to fight in a deadly war they couldn't win. The Hmongs were promised sanctuary in the U.S. after the
                war, but as it turned out, less than 4000 were allowed sanctuary in the U.S. after the war. Some were
                accepted into France, Austrailia, and the ones who didn't get rescued were left to defend for themselves
                or flee as refugees to Thailand. Many of the surviving soldiers and their families were labeled as
                rebels
                and killed by the communists after the war, and those soldiers who were able to escape prosecution, ran
                and hid in the jungles. Some are still hiding in the jungles of Laos even today.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In the mid-80's, my family and I were fortunate enough to escape to Thailand. My parents can still
                recall those times quite clearly: dWe traveled by foot, mostly at night, until we reached the Mekong
                River,
                which separated Thailand and Laos. One would need to have enough money to bribe a Thai boat to take his
                family across, otherwise, those who didn't would have to swim. They'd also have to make sure you have
                enough to bribe officials on the other side if they get caught. Anyone could be shot on the boat at any
                time by snipers on either side.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Once in Thailand, Hmong people were put into refugee camps and were only able to be admitted into the US
                if they already had relatives living in the U.S. and if they received a sponsorship.
                I get so emotional when I talk about the Hmong history because it's sad and tragic, and because the U.S.
                government hid the details of the secret war for so long, that Hmong people still don't get the
                recognition
                for their sacrifice.
