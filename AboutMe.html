        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I was born in Laos, and came to the U.S. in the mid 80's.
            My family settled in La Cross, WI because it was where we had family,
            and I've called Wisconsin home ever since.</p>

        <h1>Why Do I Code?</h1>
        <p>
            There were times when I’d come up with great ideas for apps, but I didn’t know how to code and make them
            into realities. Those were the times when I wished I knew how to code. I’ve always been interested in
            coding, since I love working with Excel. My interest in coding grew over the last five years and
            eventually
            in 2018, I started doing serious research on how to learn and possibly make it into a career. With that
            in
            mind, I decided to self-study with web developer courses on Udemy to learn some basic coding. After a
            year
            of self-studying 3 hours a day, I discovered that I really liked to code; I enjoyed solving problems,
            building things, and feeling that euphoria when things work!

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In 2020, I finally made the decision to quit my job and enroll in devCodeCamp, a fulltime, full-stack
            software engineer bootcamp based in Milwaukee, WI. It was very tough and fast-paced, but overall, I
            gained a
            great deal: I was able to add to my list of programming skills as well as problem solving skills, gain
            experience collaborating with others, and develop a better understanding of coding logic. Bootcamp was
            definitely the correct choice for me. After graduating, I look forward to continue learning and
            improving my
            coding skills.

        </p>
        <h1>My Career Goals</h1>
        <p>
            My goals are to continue learning and developing my programming skills so that I can become a useful
            team
            member. I hope to find a position in the industry to cement my career and further those goals.

        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, reading, cooking, eating, hiking, camping, and painting. My favorite
            hobby
            of all is traveling. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I enjoy traveling within the States, but I especially love traveling to other countries and exploring their
            culture and history. My overseas
            travels
            have taken me to Japan, South Korea, South Africa, and Thailand so far. My future travel plans include, and
            not in any particular order, Ireland,
            Italy, Greece, France, Singapore, Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, Iceland and the list goes on. I feel very
            fortunate to have been able to live in Japan and South Africa. </p>

        <div class="hmong-1">
            <p>
                My ethnicity is Hmong, and although we’re a minority still unknown to much of the country, we have a
                deep history with the United States. If you haven’t heard of the Hmongs and how they came to be in
                the United State, I’ve provided a little bit of history from my own experience and personal
                knowledge.
