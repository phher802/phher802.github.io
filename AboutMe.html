            <p>I was born in Laos and came to the United States in the late 80’s via sponsorship.  We settled in La Crosse, WI because it was where we had family and where our sponsor lived.  After a few years, we moved to central Wisconsin to be closer to my Uncle, and it was where I grew up and spent most of my childhood.  I went to the University of Wisconsin – Milwaukee, where I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Global Studies Business Management.  </p>

        <h1>Why Do I Code?</h1>
        <div class="wdic">
            <p>
                I’ve always loved technology, I am very tech savvy, and coding has always been such an interesting concept to me.  However, it felt unreachable to me because I thought I needed a computer science degree, or that I had to be very good at math.  Over the years, after meeting a few software engineers, I was told that I could learn it on my own, and I was really floored by that!  I’ve been wanting to make some web applications to make my life easier, and I had so many ideas: budgeting, shopping, note taking, etc.  There’re already a lot of apps available out there, but I wanted to customize my apps to fit my needs.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I got started by setting a goal to learn coding, and spent three hours every day after work teaching myself JavaScript, and from there I also learned the MERN stack.  I absolutely fell in love with React! I learned React Hooks with functional components, and it wasn't until recently that I learned React also had class-based components. To me, functional components with Hooks are cleaner and a better way to reuse components and state.    
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My initial goal was to learn coding as a hobby, but I’ve realized I finally found something I wanted to do!  I was determined to get an education but going back to school was not an option so I decided to enroll devCodeCamp.  It was an immersive, intensive, and collaborative online bootcamp and it was exactly what I was looking for.  It was challenging and pushed me out of my comfort zone, but I really enjoyed it, even when I was feeling stressed out because when I finally found a solution, it was the best feeling ever.  I hope that I can continue to learn new technologies and I love that I can never stop learning.

        <h1>My Career Goals</h1>
        <div class="wdic">
            <p>
                I want to continue learning new technologies and developing my programming skills so that I can make a difference wherever I go, and 5+ years down the road, I can proudly earn the title of senior developer.  I would also like to someday be able to mentor new programmers coming into the tech space.  I love that the tech community is so open and helpful, and I’m really happy that I can be a part of the community.

        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <div class="wdic">
            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, reading, cooking, eating, hiking, camping, and painting. My favorite
                hobby
                of all is traveling. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I enjoy traveling within the States, but I especially love traveling to other countries and exploring their
                culture and history. My overseas
                travels
                have taken me to Japan, South Korea, South Africa, and Thailand so far. My future travel plans include, and
                not in any particular order, Ireland,
                Italy, Greece, France, Singapore, Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, Iceland and the list goes on. I feel very
                fortunate to have been able to live in Japan and South Africa. </p>

        <div class="hmong-1 wdic">
            <p>
                My ethnicity is Hmong, and although we’re a minority still unknown to much of the country, we have a
                deep history with the United States. If you haven’t heard of the Hmongs and how they came to be in
                the United State, I’ve provided a little bit of history from my own experience and personal
                knowledge.
