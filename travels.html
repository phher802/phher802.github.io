        <h2>Osaka, Japan</h2>
        <p>
            In 2011, I went to Osaka, Japan, for my study abroad program. It was at the end of the same month when one
            of the worst and deadliest tsunamis in Japan’s history devastated the northeastern coast of Japan. They felt
            small earthquakes for months afterwards. My family was not very happy about me going but I assured them my
            destination was Osaka, which was quite far from the Miyagi Prefecture, where the tsunami happened.

            Japan was beautiful, and the people were so kind. I felt very at peace when I lived there; it was a feeling
            I’d never felt before and it was a wonderful feeling. Luckily, I was there during the spring semester, so I
            was able to enjoy the beautiful cherry blossoms. They were everywhere! I even had a chance to travel to the
            countryside and saw how beautiful their mountains and valleys were. During my time there, I stayed with a
            host family; it allowed me to be able to enjoy traditional Japanese food in a home setting and have daily
            conversations in Japanese. I made friends from all over the world and was able to live as a local. I will
            always cherish the experience.

            After the semester was over, I travel around Japan for a week: Tokyo to Kyoto to Fukuoka. Then I hopped on a
            ferry in Fukuoka to Busan, South Korea and then to Seoul. I spent a week in South Korea with my American
            friends who were living there at the time. South Korea was also beautiful, and their food is delicious. I
            would go back to South Korea just to eat the food.
            I am so thankful for my friend taking his time out of his work schedule to show me around. It was a great
            experience. I hope to go back to Japan and South Korea someday.

        <h2>Cape Town, South Africa</h2>
        <p>
            In 2014, I went to Cape Town, South Africa for a two-month, unpaid internship as part of my undergrad
            program. I worked with the non-profit called Operation Smile, which help children undergo surgical
            operations to fix their cleft palate. They do such amazing work, and I am grateful to have been a part of
            it. I only wished I was able to go along out into the field with the field team.

            There are so many beautiful and romantic places around and in Cape Town. I went to several beaches, hiked up
            to Table Mountain (one of the Seven Wonders of the world), hiked other smaller mountains and hills, visited
            botanical gardens, whale watched, ate at many different food markets, and did some shopping. The only thing
            I didn’t do was a Safari. It was tempting but the excursion was for three days and I didn’t have that kind
            of time. One of the highlights during my time there, was when I took a trip out to Robben Island. It is the
            island where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned. The tour guide showed us his cell, where he sat to read/write
            his books, and his routines during imprisonment. Most of the tour guides used to be prison inmates, so that
            was interesting.

            It was a very different experience from Japan, since it wasn’t as carefree and I didn’t feel that
            peacefulness I felt in Japan, but it was still a very memorable and interesting experience. Even though Cape
            Town was beautiful, there was also the dark side of the city. There was a lot of theft and mugging, and
            homelessness was also a big problem. Even after the apartheid, segregation was still very much alive.
            Luckily, I did not experience anything worse than catcalls during my walks to and from my internship.
            Cape Town has always been on my bucket list, although I never dreamt I’d be able to live there. The
            experience will definitely stay with me. Unlike Japan and South Korea, I do not plan to go back to visit. I
            think Cape Town was great as a one-time experience.

        <h2>Thailand</h2>
        <p>
            In 2018, I decided to go to Thailand for vacation. It ended up being a solo vacation, which was a first for
            me. It would be the first time I returned to Thailand since before coming to the U.S. I had a great time; I
            went to Phuket to see the beaches and ate exotic fruits, then spent the rest of the time in Bangkok. I took
            a bike tour and a food tour; both were great and helped me see more of the city. I wanted to relax so I
            didn’t do a lot of traveling around to other cities, and I didn’t try too hard to do touristy activities.

            Even though I enjoyed my trip, I realized there were pros and cons to traveling solo. The biggest pro was
            that I could do whatever I wanted on a whim, and the biggest con was that I wasn’t able to taste/eat as much
            food as I liked to. In Phuket, I had gone to a food festival/market and even though I wanted to buy
            everything, I couldn’t because I wouldn’t have had the time or stomach capacity to eat them all. I ended up
            with four food items and I almost couldn’t finish them. It was the same for Bangkok; there were so many
            different dishes to try but I could only eat so much without wasting food.

            Overall, I think everyone should do a solo vacation at least once, but as a woman, choose a safe country to
            go to. I felt pretty safe during my time in Thailand and didn’t run into any problems. People were very nice
            and helpful, and I had Google Translate to help me most of the time. I would love to go back to Thailand and
            visit Chiang Mai, a city in Northern Thailand, or to Krabi, an island in the south.
