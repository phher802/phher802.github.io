        <div class="hmong-1">
            <p>I'd like to talk a little bit about the history about the Hmong people, because I am Hmong and my people's history and
                legacy are still unknown to a lot of Americans even though we are a part of the American history.
                Sadly the Hmong people don't have a country to call home. As many of the elders remember it,
                Hmong people originated from northern China, which make a lot people think we're Mongolians,
                which we are not, and nor are we Chinese or claim to be. Hmong people have always been
                considered hilltribes or indegenous because they're mostly simple farmers who live in the hills.
                The Chinese labeled the Hmongs as the Miao, but the Hmongs consider the name a deragortory term.
                The story was, the Chinese King had a disagreement with the leader of the Hmong people,
                therefore the Hmongs were forced to leave or face prosecution. Most of the Hmongs migrated
                down towards the Southeast countries like Laos and Thailand. The ones who chose to stay in China
                hid their identities and changed their language so they could blend in with the Chinese.
                This was way before my grandparents' time, but since the Hmongs didn't have a written language
                back then, stories are passed down through the spoken language. I've heard that in the last 10 years,
                the Hmong-Chinese have finally started to feel safe enough to re-establish their Hmong identities
                in China again. The way they speak the Hmong language is very odd, it sounds almost
                Chinese.

            <h3 class="font-monts">The Hmongs and The U.S. Government</h3>
            <p>Unbeknowest to a lot of Americans still, it was due to a stint the CIA conducted in the 1960s during the
                Vietnam War. The CIA dubbed it the Secret War; it was so secret that it was hidden from the American
                people for so long that the history is still not very well known today. Although the Secreat War was
                finally revealed to the public in the 70s, they still left out how the Hmong people were detrimental
                to the "secret mission" in Laos. The Hmongs, simple hilltribe farmers, were turned in guerrilas soldiers
                to fight in a deadly war they couldn't win. The Hmongs were promised sanctuary in the U.S. after the
                war, but as it turned out, less than 4000 were allowed sanctuary in the U.S. after the war. Some were
                accepted into France, Austrailia, and the ones who didn't get rescued were left to defend for themselves
                or flee as refugees to Thailand. Many of the surviving soldiers and their families were labeled as
                rebels
                and killed by the communists after the war, and those soldiers who were able to escape prosecution, ran
                and hid in the jungles. Some are still hiding in the jungles of Laos even today.

                In the mid-80's, my family and I were fortunate enough to escape to Thailand. My parents can still
                recall those times quite clearly: dWe traveled by foot, mostly at night, until we reached the Mekong
                River,
                which separated Thailand and Laos. One would need to have enough money to bribe a Thai boat to take his
                family across, otherwise, those who didn't would have to swim. They'd also have to make sure you have
                enough to bribe officials on the other side if they get caught. Anyone could be shot on the boat at any
                time by snipers on either side.

                Once in Thailand, Hmong people were put into refugee camps and were only able to be admitted into the US
                if they already had relatives living in the U.S. and if they received a sponsorship.
                I get so emotional when I talk about the Hmong history because it's sad and tragic, and because the U.S.
                government hid the details of the secret war for so long, that Hmong people still don't get the
                recognition
                for their sacrifice.
