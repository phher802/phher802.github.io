        <div class="hmong-1">
            <p>The Hmong people originated from northern China. However, we do not consider ourselves Chinese. Our
                languages are different, both spoken and written, and the cultural aspects are also different. Hmong
                people were considered a hill tribe because they lived mostly in the mountainous areas. There are still
                some Hmong people living in China today; their languages would probably have melded with the Chinese
                language a bit. The story that had been passed down was that the Chinese had tried to rule over the
                Hmong hill tribe, and when the Hmongs resisted, they were told to either leave the country or be
                executed. Many Hmong people fled China, mostly to Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and the other neighboring
                countries. Those who chose to remain in China hid their identities and lived as Chinese citizens. It was
                just in the last decade that these Hmong-Chinese felt safe to come out of hiding and reclaimed their
                Hmong heritage. My great-grandparents fled and settled in Laos, and that was where my family lived until
                the Vietnam Secret War.

            <p>Unbeknowest to a lot of Americans still, the Secret War was due to a stint the CIA conducted in the 1960s
                during the
                Vietnam War. The CIA dubbed it the Secret War and it was hidden from the American
                people for so long that this piece of American history is still not very well known today. Although the Secret War was
                finally revealed to the public in the 70s, they still left out how the Hmong people were detrimental
                to the "secret mission" in Laos. The Hmongs, simple hilltribe farmers in Laos, were turned into
                guerrilas soldiers
                to fight in a deadly war they couldn't win. The CIA promised the Hmongs sanctuary in the U.S. if they lose the war, 
                but less than 4,000 Hmongs were allowed sanctuary in the U.S. Some were
                accepted into France and Austrailia, and the rest were left to fend for themselves against the communist
                rule in Laos. Many of the
                surviving soldiers and their families were labeled as rebels
                and were killed by the communists after the war. The soldiers who were able to escape prosecution, ran
                and hid in the jungles. Some are still hiding in the jungles of Laos even today.

                In the mid-80's, my family and I were fortunate enough to escape to Thailand. My parents can still
                recall those times quite clearly: We traveled by foot, mostly at night, until we reached the Mekong
                River,
                which separated Thailand and Laos. One would need to have enough money to bribe a boat from Thailand to take his
                family across, otherwise, those who didn't have enough money or couldn't secure a boat, would have to swim across. 
                Those people most often drowned. They also have to make sure they had
                enough money to bribe officials in Thailand if they were caught crossing. Anyone could be shot on the boat at any
                time by snipers on either side.  Luckily, we were able to cross the river by boat and made it safely to Thailand.

                Once in Thailand, Hmong people were put into refugee camps and were only able to be admitted into the U.S.
                if they had relatives among those 4,000 Hmongs who were first rescued, and even then, only if those relatives could support the refugees financially.
                My mom recalled the day we left the Thailand refugee camp called Ban Vinai. She said whenever buses came to take people bound for the U.S., 
                the whole village would some to see them off, and it was the same that day. I think we can all agree the Hmongs have a very sad and tragic history, and because the U.S.
                government hid the details of the secret war for so long, Hmong people still do not get the
                recognition they deserved, for their sacrifices to the U.S. government.
